## Features

- **Speed**: Built with Rust, the AM Algorithm offers impressive performance for real-time applications.
- **Accuracy**: It matches anime titles with high precision, even in the face of unclear or incomplete data.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple title formats, making it adaptable to various use cases.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for developers to integrate into their applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with AM Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Mr-MH0001/am-algorithm/releases) to download the latest version. Execute the downloaded file to set up the utility on your system.

2. **Install Rust**: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

3. **Clone the Repository**: If you want to contribute or modify the code, clone the repository using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-MH0001/am-algorithm.git
   cd am-algorithm
   ```

4. **Build the Project**: Run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **Run the Utility**: Execute the following command to start using the AM Algorithm:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/am-algorithm
   ```

## Usage

The AM Algorithm is designed for ease of use. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use it:

```rust
use am_algorithm::match_title;

fn main() {
    let input = "Naruto";
    let matched_title = match_title(input);
    println!("Matched Title: {}", matched_title);
}
```

### Input Formats

You can provide titles in various formats:

- **English**: "Attack on Titan"
- **Romaji**: "Shingeki no Kyojin"
- **Native**: "ÈÄ≤ÊíÉ„ÅÆÂ∑®‰∫∫"
- **Alternative**: "AOT"

### Output

The utility will return the most accurate match based on the input provided. It can handle typos and variations effectively.

## How It Works

The AM Algorithm uses advanced string matching techniques to process inputs. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of the algorithm:

1. **Normalization**: Input titles are normalized to reduce discrepancies. This includes converting to lowercase and removing special characters.

2. **Tokenization**: The algorithm breaks down titles into tokens, allowing for more granular matching.

3. **Scoring**: Each potential match is scored based on various factors, including edit distance and token overlap.

4. **Ranking**: The best matches are ranked, and the highest-scoring title is returned.

This process ensures that the utility can handle a wide range of inputs while maintaining high accuracy.

## Contributing
